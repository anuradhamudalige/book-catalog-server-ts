# Book Catalog Server

This API is created with NodeJS (Typescript). This complete rework for my JS [repository](https://github.com/anuradhamudalige/book-catalog-server) via TS.

##Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open the `src/app.ts`file and place your book application url which is hosted. Default is pointed to http://localhost:1337

## Development server

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Server will be listening on `http://localhost:1337/`.

## Build

- Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Developer
